**2Bucket** is a lightweight, self-hosted file storage service inspired by the concept of “buckets” in object storage.
With it, anyone can spin up their own bucket system on a VPS or private server — no third-party services required.

### ✨ Features

* 📁 **Independent buckets** – each bucket is an isolated storage space.
* 🗂️ **Flexible folder structure** – organize files in custom directories (`company/user/avatars/...`).
* 🔑 **Token-based authentication (WIP)** – control access to your files.
* ⬆️ **File upload** – upload files with support for:

  * choosing the target folder
  * optional `rename` flag to store files with a custom name
* ⬇️ **Direct download** – retrieve files easily by bucket and path.
* 🐳 **Docker-ready** – run anywhere with a simple container setup.

### 💡 Why 2Bucket?

2Bucket was built for developers and teams who want a **minimal, open-source, and fully controlled storage solution**.
Forget S3, Google Cloud, or Azure — here, *you own the infrastructure*.
